## MBTI

### Introduction

This is a MBTI test based on cognitive functions. You don't have any idea about what I am talking about ? Here are some documentation that can Help you: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">MBTI</a>
/<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/">cognitive functions (Eng)</a> / <a href="http://www.16-types.fr/modele/modele-MBTI-6-dynamique.html">cognitive functions (FR)</a>
### How the algorithm works ?
There is 80 questions. 10 questions by function. To sort the "probability" of a MBTI type, there is a comparaison between the "N-th" function by Score VS the "N-th" function of this MBTI type multiplied by a coefficient
## Language
You can choose to answer the questions in English or in French

## Fonctionnalities
- At the begginning of the program, you can choose between a test or a code. A code, can be usefull, when you did a test once, and you want to get your result again. The code is given to you at the end of your test.


# How to install Python?

## Install Python 
If Python is not installed on your computer (to verify that, you can do: "```python --version```" on a Terminal. If you don't know how to access a Terminal you can click here :<a href="https://www.ionos.com/help/email/troubleshooting-mail-basicmail-business/access-the-command-prompt-or-terminal/"> How to access a Terminal</a>) you can click on this link <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Installing Python</a>, than click on "Download Python 3.X.X". After that, you can execute this File. A window should appear. At the bottom of the screen, there is a small box where it's written: "Add Python3.X to path". Check this box. After that, click on "Customize Installation". Check all the boxes if they aren't checked and click on "Next". Then, click on "Install". After that, you can close the window

## Install MBTI_test
To install MBTI_test you need to download this project as a .zip, then you have to decompress it. After the installation and the decompression, you have to execute it by doing ```py main.py``` in the correct folder</br>
**⚠️** Make sure that you are in the good Folder when you do that. For example, if the file is on your Desktop you should do ```cd Desktop```. You don't understand what I just said? Path of a file in <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00015251">Windows</a> / <a href="https://www.switchingtomac.com/tutorials/osx/5-ways-to-reveal-the-path-of-a-file-on-macos/">Mac</a>. How to use CD: <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-use-quotcdquot-command-in-command-prompt-window"> Here </a>(It's the same with Mac) **⚠️**
Librairies needed:
```os, numpy, matplotlib, time, random, re, math, itertools```
But most of thoses are certainly, already installed with your Python.
