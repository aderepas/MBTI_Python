## MBTI

### Introduction

This is a MBTI test based on cognitive functions. You have don't have any idea about what I am talking about ? Here are some documentation that can Help you: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">MBTI</a>
/<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/">cognitive functions (Eng)</a> / <a href="http://www.16-types.fr/modele/modele-MBTI-6-dynamique.html">cognitive functions (FR)</a>
### How the algorithm works ?
Initially there is a series of 40 questions. 10 questions for each function duality. Then, the algorithm sorts these functions according to their presence. Then, thanks to a sorting algorithm, it evaluates the most probable type according to your results.
## Language
There are two versions of the program, one in French and one in English. The reason why I made 2 separate files and not the same English/French is also due to the comments. Indeed, some parts can be complex to understand. The comments are therefore translated. 

# How to install Python?

## Install Python 
If Python is not installed on your computer (to verify that, you can do: "```python --version```" on a Terminal. If you don't know how to access a Terminal you can click here :<a href="https://www.ionos.com/help/email/troubleshooting-mail-basicmail-business/access-the-command-prompt-or-terminal/"> How to access a Terminal</a>) you can click on this link <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Installing Python</a>, than click on "Download Python 3.X.X". After that, you can execute this File. A window should appear. At the bottom of the screen, there is a small box where it's written: "Add Python3.X to path". Check this box. After that, click on "Customize Installation". Check all the boxes if they aren't checked and click on "Next". Then, click on "Install". After that, you can close the window

## Install MBTI_test
To install MBTI_test you need to download this project as a .zip, then you have to decompress it. After the installation and the decompression, you have to execute it by doing ```py MBTI_test.py``` for the French version and ```py ENGMBTI_test.py``` if you want to do it in English</br>
**⚠️** Make sure that you are in the good Folder when you do that. For example, if the file is on your Desktop you should do ```cd Desktop```. You don't understand what I just said?
